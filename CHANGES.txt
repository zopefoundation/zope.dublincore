3.7.0 (2010-08-19)
==================

- Removed backward-compatibility shims for deprecated ``zope.app.dublincore.*``
  permissions.

- Removed include the zcml configuration of ``zope.dublincore.browser``.

- Using python`s doctest instead of deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest``.


3.6.3 (2010-04-23)
==================

- Restored backward-compatible ``zope.app.dublincore.*`` permissions,
  mapping them onto the new permissions using the ``<meta:redefinePermission>``
  directive.  These shims will be removed in 3.7.0.

- Added unit (not functional) test for loadability of ``configure.zcml``.


3.6.2 (2010-04-20)
==================

- Repaired regression introduced in 3.6.1:  the renamed permissions were
  not updated in other ZCML files.


3.6.1 (2010-04-19)
==================

- Renamed the ``zope.app.dublincore.*`` permissions to
  ``zope.dublincore.*``.  Applications may need to fix up grants based on the
  old permissions.

- Added tests for ``zope.dublincore.timeannotators``.

- Added not declared dependency on ``zope.lifecycleevent``.


3.6.0 (2009-12-02)
==================

- Removed the marker interface IZopeDublinCoreAnnotatable which doesn't seem
  to be used.

- Made the registration of ZDCAnnotatableAdapter conditional, lifting the
  dependency on zope.annotation and thereby the ZODB, leaving it as a test
  dependency.


3.5.0 (2009-09-15)
==================

- Add missing dependencies.

- Get rid of any testing dependencies beyond zope.testing.

- Include browser ZCML configuration only if zope.browserpage is installed.

- Specify i18n domain in package's ``configure.zcml``, because we use message
  IDs for permission titles.

- Remove unused imports, fix one test that was inactive because of being
  overriden by another one by a mistake.


3.4.2 (2009-01-31)
==================

- Declare dependency on zope.datetime.


3.4.1 (2009-01-26)
==================

- Test dependencies are declared in a `test` extra now.

- Fix: Make CreatorAnnotator not to fail if participation principal is None


3.4.0 (2007-09-28)
==================

No further changes since 3.4.0a1.


3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
====================

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.dublincore
from Zope 3.4.0a1
